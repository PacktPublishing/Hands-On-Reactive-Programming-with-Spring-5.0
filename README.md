# -Hands-On Reactive Programming with Spring 5.0
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Reactive Programming with Spring 5.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/hands-on-reactive-programming-with-spring-5-0-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.



## About the Video Course
This course will introduce you to the concept of reactive programming and how reactive applications scale vertically rather than horizontally. You will learn about the Spring Reactor project that is at the heart of Spring by creating a simple reactive app with the Flux and Mono APIs. You will create a reactive app that is ready for the cloud, then look at how to use this in a web context using the Spring Web Flux module and implement router functions to build reactive web services that work in the cloud. You'll then debug your application and move on to a complete project example using Spring Web Flux, Spring Data, and router functions. Lastly, you will learn how to test your code using the reactor-test dependency.
